This project is a coursework assignment for the Web Design course, where we were required to create a CV website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Laravel framework. The CV website is intended to introduce ourselves and showcase our portfolio to potential employers or clients.

In this project, we utilized the latest web development technologies, including the Laravel framework. We also used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website's interface and interactions.

The project features a profile page, portfolio, work experience, skills, and contact page. Additionally, we also used various libraries and plugins to enhance the website's functionality and appearance, such as Bootstrap.

We hope that this project can serve as an example and reference for fellow students who want to learn web development using the latest technologies and popular frameworks like Laravel.
